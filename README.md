# Lead-Scoring-Assignment
1. Lead Scoring Assignment
**Problem Introduction
**Challenge:
Low lead conversion rate (30%) despite a high number of leads.
Need to identify "Hot Leads" for efficient conversion improvement.
**Desired Outcome:
**Build a lead scoring model that assigns scores to leads, predicting their conversion likelihood.
Target lead conversion rate of 80%.
**Data:
**Information about leads, including their source, website interaction, demographics, etc.
Label indicating whether a lead converted (1) or not (0).
**Actionable Points:
**Analyze potential features for the model (e.g., website visits, time spent, source).
Recommend suitable machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
Provide an example of building a lead scoring model using a specific technique.
